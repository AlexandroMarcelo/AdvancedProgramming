How to view binary files in hexadecimal:

xxd file
xxd -b file     # Will show the bytes as binary numbers

hexdump -C file


Another option:
    Install the program hexedit



In  order to use this program, using manually created threads, you must have an image with extension .ppm (in binary or ascii form) and a filter with extension .txt, and a resulting file with extension .ppm:
	The filter file: Must start with the height and width of the matrix, then the matrix. The matrix must be square (both sides equal), and the sides must be odd numbers greater than 1 (ex.: 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.).
	Example:
		3 3
		-1 -1 -1
		-1 8 -1
		-1 -1 -1

you open your terminal inside of the folder of this project and type make.

Then you run the program as usual with the parameters, to take the image through the filter, an example:
	time ./test_ppm -i HOT_Balloon_Trip.ppm -o result.ppm -f filter.txt 

The meaning of the flags:
	-i: input file, the input image as .ppm
	-o: output file, where the filtered image going to store.
	-f: filter file, where the matrix is
